# Multi Agent Collaboration with Strands
As autonomous systems evolve, collaboration between multiple agents is moving from theoretical to essential. With agents gaining advanced reasoning, adaptability, and tool use, the question is no longer *“Can one agent solve a task?”* but *“How can many agents work together effectively?”*

## The Shift Toward Multi-Agent Systems



The **Supervisor pattern**, introduced in our earlier work on asynchronous AI agents with Amazon Bedrock, provided the first step in this direction. Acting as a centralized orchestrator, the Supervisor manages loosely coupled agents by delegating tasks, handling fallbacks, and tracking state. This enables organizations to progress from single-agent prototypes to early multi-agent systems.

But as systems grow more dynamic, the limitations of static supervision appear. Workflows shift constantly, new capabilities emerge, and coordination must adapt in real time. This is where the **Arbiter pattern** enters—the next evolution of agentic orchestration, designed for adaptive, scalable, and context-aware coordination.

---

## From Supervisor to Arbiter

The Supervisor model works well with predictable workflows and stable agents. However, modern environments demand more: the ability to dynamically create agents, semantically match tasks, and coordinate through a shared state.

The **Arbiter pattern** extends the Supervisor with three core innovations:

1. **Semantic Capability Matching** – The Arbiter reasons about what kind of agent is required, even if no such agent yet exists.
2. **Delegated Agent Creation** – When a suitable agent isn’t found, the Arbiter invokes a **Fabricator agent** to generate a new agent dynamically.
3. **Task Planning with Contextual Memory** – Tasks are decomposed into plans, tracked in memory, retried if needed, and evaluated for agent performance.

This shifts orchestration from *static supervision* to *adaptive coordination*.

## The Blackboard Model Revisited

The Arbiter Pattern borrows principles from the **blackboard model**, a classic architecture from distributed AI. In this approach, agents share a common workspace (“the blackboard”), posting partial solutions or updates. Other agents observe and react, driving collaborative problem-solving.

In our implementation, the blackboard becomes a **semantic event substrate**:

* Agents publish and consume task-relevant states.
* The Arbiter coordinates through these semantic events.
* Collaboration becomes event-driven and loosely coupled.

This design enables adaptability at scale—where agents don’t need rigid APIs, only the ability to respond to evolving state.

## How the Arbiter Works

The Arbiter follows a structured event-driven workflow:

1. **Interpretation** – An LLM interprets the event, extracting objectives and sub-tasks.
2. **Capability Assessment** – The Arbiter evaluates available agents via a local index or capability manifests.
3. **Delegation or Generation** –

   * If an agent exists, tasks are routed directly.
   * If no agent exists, the Arbiter requests a **Fabricator** to create one.
4. **Blackboard Coordination** – All participating agents read/write to the shared blackboard.
5. **Reflection and Adaptation** – Performance is logged and used to refine future coordination or trigger new agent creation.

### Arbiter vs Supervisor

* **Supervisor:** Orchestration relies on a static configuration list.
* **Arbiter:** Coordination adapts dynamically through a shared semantic blackboard.

This enables mid-task adjustments, richer collaboration, and continuous learning.

## The Fabricator Agent: On-Demand Capability Creation

The **Fabricator** expands the Arbiter’s adaptability by generating new agents when existing ones cannot handle a task.

### How It Works

* Receives capability requirements from the Arbiter.
* Generates new worker agent code using Strands.
* Stores the agent in S3 for runtime use.
* Registers capabilities in DynamoDB for immediate availability.
* Publishes the new agent into the system for orchestration.

This approach transforms systems from being *pre-programmed* to *self-expanding*.

---

## The Generic Wrapper: Dynamic Execution Runtime

To run these new agents without provisioning extra infrastructure, the **Generic Wrapper** enables hot-loading:

* Agents are executed from code stored in S3.
* A single wrapper dynamically loads and executes agent code.
* Results are published back via EventBridge for Arbiter tracking.

This decouples **agent growth** from **infrastructure scaling**, allowing hundreds of agents to exist without operational bottlenecks.

### Benefits of Hot-Loading

* **Scalable:** Supports unlimited agent creation.
* **Efficient:** Avoids new infrastructure for every agent.
* **Standardized:** All agents communicate through consistent event structures.
* **Resilient:** Failures are isolated and handled gracefully.

## End-to-End Workflow

1. **Event received** → Arbiter interprets and decomposes tasks.
2. **Capability check** → Finds matching agent or requests Fabricator.
3. **Fabricator invoked** → Generates new agent if needed, registers it.
4. **Generic Wrapper executes** → Hot-loads and runs agent code.
5. **Shared blackboard updated** → Agents collaborate via semantic state.
6. **Reflection loop** → Arbiter logs outcomes, adapts future workflows.

---

## Key Capabilities of the Arbiter System

* **Asynchronous Processing** – SQS-based task distribution.
* **Persistent State Management** – DynamoDB workflow tracking.
* **Scalability** – Hot-loading architecture supports endless agent growth.
* **Intelligent Orchestration** – LLMs decompose tasks and sequence workflows.
* **Self-Expanding Capabilities** – Strands-based agent creation on demand.
* **Standardized Communication** – Event-driven protocols ensure reliability.

## Conclusion: From Supervision to Adaptation

The Arbiter Pattern represents a leap forward from static orchestration toward **adaptive, generative, and resilient coordination**. By combining semantic reasoning, dynamic agent creation, and blackboard-based collaboration, it transforms agent ecosystems into **self-evolving systems**.

Where the Supervisor gave us order, the Arbiter gives us adaptability—paving the way for decentralized, intelligent, multi-agent systems that can **learn, adapt, and collaborate at scale**.
