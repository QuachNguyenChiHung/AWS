# Event Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"

### Time and Topic

- **Time:** Saturday, November 15, 2025 (8:30 AM – 12:00 PM)
- **Topic:** AI/ML/GenAI on AWS

### Event Objectives

- Provide an overview of AWS **AI/ML** services.
- Introduce **Amazon SageMaker** in detail – the end-to-end ML platform.
- Deep dive into **Generative AI (GenAI)** and Foundation Models through **Amazon Bedrock**.
- Guide through **Prompt Engineering** techniques and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture.

### Speaker List

- Detailed speaker information was not available in the original data; assumed to be Solution Architects from AWS Vietnam.

### Key Highlights

#### 1. AWS AI/ML Services Overview

- **Amazon SageMaker:** Complete Machine Learning lifecycle including data preparation, training, tuning, model deployment, and integrated **MLOps**.
- **Live Demo:** Hands-on operations with **SageMaker Studio**.

#### 2. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

- **Foundation Models:** Comparison and guidance on selecting between models like **Claude, Llama, Titan**.
- **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced techniques such as **Chain-of-Thought reasoning** and **Few-shot learning**.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Architecture and integration with **Knowledge Base** to enhance accuracy and context for GenAI.
- **Bedrock Agents & Guardrails:** Building multi-step workflows and **Guardrails** mechanisms (content moderation) to ensure safety.

### Key Takeaways

#### GenAI and ML Skills

- **End-to-end ML Deployment:** Mastered the fundamental steps to build and deploy ML models on **SageMaker** effectively.
- **Bedrock Mastery:** Gained deep understanding of **Bedrock** components and capabilities of different Foundation Models.
- **RAG Techniques:** Grasped that **RAG** architecture is the key element for bringing GenAI into real-world enterprise applications with private data.

### Application to Work

- **Building GenAI Proof-of-Concept (PoC):** Using **Amazon Bedrock** to quickly experiment with GenAI use cases (e.g., document summarization, chatbots based on internal knowledge) with RAG techniques.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Applying learned **Prompt Engineering** techniques to improve response quality from large language models.

### Event Experience

- **In-depth Practice:** The **Live Demos** on SageMaker and Bedrock were highly valuable, providing real-world insights into service deployment.
- **Focus on Details:** The event delved deep into technical aspects like model selection and prompt optimization, giving me more solid knowledge compared to events that are merely introductory.

> This event provided a solid foundation for me to start working with Machine Learning and Generative AI projects on AWS.
