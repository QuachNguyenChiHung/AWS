# Event Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #2: DevOps on AWS"

### Time and Topic

- **Time:** Monday, November 17, 2025 (1:00 PM – 4:30 PM)
- **Topic:** DevOps on AWS

### Event Objectives

- Provide deep insights into **DevOps** principles, processes, and best practices on the AWS platform.
- Introduce and guide the use of **AWS Developer Tools** suite (CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CodePipeline) to build automated **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Focus on advanced deployment strategies like **Blue/Green Deployment** and **Canary Release** to minimize risks.
- Explore how to integrate **Security (DevSecOps)** and **Monitoring** into the DevOps cycle.

### Speaker List

- Detailed speaker information was not available in the original data; assumed to be Solution Architects from AWS Vietnam.

### Key Highlights

#### 1. DevOps Principles and AWS Developer Tools

- **DevOps Culture & Principles:** Focus on automation, monitoring, and continuous improvement.
- **Building CI/CD:** Guide on using AWS CodePipeline to create a continuous deployment flow from code commit to production.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Introduction to AWS CloudFormation and AWS CDK for managing infrastructure resources with code.

#### 2. Advanced Deployment Strategies

- **Zero-Downtime Deployment:** Analysis of advanced deployment techniques:
  - **Blue/Green Deployment:** Deploy new version alongside the old version, then switch traffic.
  - **Canary Release:** Deploy new version to a small subset of users before wide rollout.
- **AWS Services in Action:** How to use AWS services like Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Lambda to support these strategies.

#### 3. Monitoring, Logging, and DevSecOps

- **Observability:** Using Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray to collect metrics, logs, and traces for quick issue detection and resolution.
- **DevSecOps:** Integrating security tools (e.g., Amazon Inspector, Amazon GuardDuty) into Build and Deploy stages for early vulnerability detection.

### Key Takeaways

#### Core DevOps Skills

- **Professional CI/CD Design:** Learned how to design a robust, resilient CI/CD Pipeline using AWS toolset.
- **Deployment Risk Minimization:** Understood the pros and cons of Blue/Green and Canary Release, and when to apply each strategy to ensure **Zero Downtime**.

#### Security and Observability

- **DevSecOps Mindset:** Grasped the importance of "Shift Left" - integrating security as early as possible in the development cycle.
- **Observability:** Understood the difference between Monitoring and Observability, and how to use **Logs, Metrics, Traces** for comprehensive system performance insights.

### Application to Work

- **Deployment Automation:** Deploy **CodePipelines** for new projects to automate the entire Build, Test, and Deploy process.
- **Improve Go-Live Strategy:** Propose and apply **Canary Release** strategies for critical features to ensure stability and gather early user feedback.
- **Enhance Observability:** Integrate X-Ray for end-to-end request tracing, helping debug distributed applications (microservices) faster.

### Event Experience

This event was a practical learning session, emphasizing the transition from theory to practice in the AWS environment.

- **Real-world Value:** Deep diving into advanced deployment strategies provided directly applicable knowledge for production environments.
- **Tool Ecosystem:** I gained better understanding of how tools in the AWS ecosystem (Code* services, CloudWatch, X-Ray) work together to create a complete DevOps workflow.

> This event strengthened my knowledge of building, deploying, and operating software efficiently, securely, and automatically on AWS.
