### Needs Improvement
* **Discipline**: Improve punctuality and consistency with schedules.
	- Actions: set daily start/end times, use a task tracker (e.g., Notion/Trello) and log work start time for 2 weeks.
	- Success metric: aim for 95% on-time starts within 4 weeks.

* **Ability to Learn**: Move from "Fair" to "Good" by learning faster and applying knowledge.
	- Actions: after each learning session, write a 10–15 minute summary and a short checklist of 3 applied tasks; complete one small project applying newly learned concepts every 2 weeks.
	- Success metric: produce 4 applied summaries/projects in 8 weeks.

* **Communication**: Improve clarity in status updates and technical explanations.
	- Actions: use a 2-line status template (What I did / Blockers / Next) in daily standups and practice explaining one technical task in writing to a peer weekly.
	- Success metric: reduce follow-up clarifying questions from reviewers by 50% in 6 weeks.

* **Problem-Solving**: Strengthen analytical approach and debugging skills.
	- Actions: adopt a root-cause checklist (reproduce → isolate → hypothesize → test → confirm) for each bug; keep a short "bug log" summarizing cause and fix.
	- Success metric: average time-to-fix critical bugs reduced by 25% over the next month.

* **Overall Professional Growth**: Convert feedback into visible improvement.
	- Actions: schedule biweekly feedback reviews with your mentor, set 2 measurable goals per review, and document progress.
